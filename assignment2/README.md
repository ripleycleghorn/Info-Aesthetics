## Assignment 2
### Visualizing Quantitative Data
For this assignment, I created a basic barchart in d3 using tutorials I found online. Although it looks simple, it was my first project in d3 so I was still able to push myself. I decided to make a chart designed for a young audience, maybe one that would be part of an educational website. I imagined the audience would be around 6th grade age. The purpose of this visualization was to show the earthquakes that had happened in the last hour; specifically the chart should include the magnitude, location, and time. I mapped magnitude to height, and placed time on the x-axis. Then I created a tooltip to reveal the location and exact magnitude. To make it more playful, I tried to make the bars similar to buildings in a city, so that they could correlate the height with something they are familiar with.

I ran into two main issues. The first had to do with the x-axis. I didn’t have time to map the original time format in milliseconds to a standard hour time format. I also wanted to fix the longitude and latitude to eliminate the negatives and replace with West, and South, respectively, and add East, and North to the positive values. The way it’s formatted right now technically isn’t accepted when entered into Google Maps. I plan on fixing both of these bugs with the next iteration.
